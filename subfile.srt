
1
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:57,504
No!

2
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:33,417
There she is. There she is.

3
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:44,249
There she is.

4
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:34,913
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

5
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:39,187
<i>I've traveled over half our state</i>
<i>to be here tonight.</i>

6
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,820
<i>I couldn't get away sooner</i>
<i>because my new well was coming in</i>

7
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:44,832
<i>at Coyote Hills</i>
<i>and I had to see about it.</i>

8
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:47,926
<i>That well is now flowing</i>
<i>at 2,000 barrels</i>

9
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,233
<i>and it's paying me an income</i>
<i>of $5,000 a week.</i>

10
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:55,206
I have two others drilling
and I have 16 producing at Antelope,

11
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:59,747
so, ladies and gentlemen,
if I say I'm an oilman, you will agree.

12
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:05,247
Now, you have a great chance here,

13
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:08,254
but bear in mind you could lose it all
if you're not careful.

14
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,756
Out of all men that beg for a chance
to drill your lots,

15
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:14,090
maybe one in twenty will be oilmen.

16
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:15,424
The rest will be speculators,

17
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:18,056
that's men trying to get between
you and the oilmen

18
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,762
to get some of the money that ought,
by rights, come to you.

19
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,806
Even if you find one that has money
and means to drill,

20
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,374
he'll maybe know nothing about drilling.

21
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:29,444
He'll have to hire the job out
on contract,

22
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:32,376
and then you're depending
on a contractor,

23
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:33,539
who'll rush the job through

24
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,742
so he can get another contract
just as quick as he can.

25
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,409
This is the way that this works.

26
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,785
What is your offer? We're wasting time.

27
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,057
Please!

28
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:47,228
I do my own drilling.

29
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:51,765
And the men that work for me,
work for me, and they are men I know.

30
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:55,598
I make it my business to be there
and to see their work.

31
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:58,798
I don't lose my tools in the hole
and spend months fishing for them.

32
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:00,067
I don't botch the cementing off

33
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:03,737
and let water in the hole
and ruin the whole lease.

34
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,870
I'm a family man.

35
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:10,611
I run a family business. This is my son
and my partner, H.W. Plainview.

36
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,421
We offer you the bond of family
that very few oilmen can understand.

37
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,454
I'm fixed like no other company
in this field

38
00:16:21,597 --> 00:16:24,760
and that's because
my Coyote Hills well has just come in.

39
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,334
I have a string of tools
all ready to put to work.

40
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:29,563
I can load a rig onto trucks
and have them here in a week.

41
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:32,765
I have business connections,
so I can get the lumber for the derricks.

42
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,674
Such things go by friendship
in a rush like this.

43
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:40,646
And this is why I can guarantee
to start drilling

44
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:43,718
and to put up the cash to back my word.

45
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:45,377
I assure you, ladies and gentlemen,

46
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:48,786
no matter what the others
promise to do,

47
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,325
when it comes to the showdown,
they won't be there.

48
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,565
Sit down! Sit down, you have no right...

49
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,400
Let us discuss what the man has to say.

50
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,594
Let us discuss what the man has to say.

51
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:02,694
- Prescott, do you trust this man?
- Let's discuss what he has to say.

52
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:06,263
- There's logic to what he's saying.
- How does he know? My lot is there!

53
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,238
Two or three years,
it could be ten years!

54
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:14,475
- We gain nothing by losing our heads!
- Look at that well out there!

55
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,107
Nobody's losing their heads.

56
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:19,646
You have no business being here!

57
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,091
Sit that woman down, sir!

58
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,125
You can sit down.

59
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:28,730
Mr. Plainview! Please, Mr. Plainview.

60
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:31,823
No, Mr. Plainview!
No, where are you going?

61
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:35,028
- I don't need the lease. Thank you.
- But we need you.

62
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,367
Too much confusion.
Thank you for your time.

63
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,134
No, no, there's no confusion.

64
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:42,938
I wouldn't take the lease
if you gave it to me as a gift.

65
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:56,386
<i>Mr. Bankside,</i>
<i>I'm not going to waste your time.</i>

66
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,960
<i>I'd certainly appreciate it</i>
<i>if you didn't waste mine.</i>

67
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:03,794
Now, if you wish to sign with me, we
can have a well drilling within 10 days.

68
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:07,300
Your lot is further north
from the discovery well up here.

69
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:09,994
That means
we'll probably have to dig deeper.

70
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:12,505
And if there's as much oil here
as I think there is,

71
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:15,633
it'll be harder to reach, but once
we find it, we can take it right out.

72
00:18:15,744 --> 00:18:20,340
We have to act quickly, because
very soon these fields will be dry.

73
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:22,780
I need you to know what you want to do.

74
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:25,911
Now, because of the distance
from the discovery well,

75
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,285
I'll pay you a smaller royalty
than you'd get down there

76
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,224
but I'm prepared to give you
a $1,000 bonus on your lot.

77
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:33,886
What kind of royalty
are you talking about?

78
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:38,433
One-sixth, plus a guarantee
to start drilling within 10 days.

79
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,765
Now, that's something
you won't find anywhere else.

80
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:52,647
What age are your children, ma'am?

81
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:54,476
Ten and twelve.

82
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:59,485
Mr. Plainview, a question, sir.
Where is your wife?

83
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:04,456
She died in childbirth, Mrs. Bankside.

84
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,859
So it's just me and my son now.

85
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,602
It's coming in, boss!

86
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,336
Hear it?

87
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,328
Mr. Plainview?

88
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,663
Yes?

89
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:51,998
Are you Daniel Plainview?

90
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:55,035
Yes.

91
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:58,680
What can I do for you?

92
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:02,313
You look for oil.

93
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:05,019
That's right.

94
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:08,180
What do you pay for a place that has it?

95
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:11,315
- Well, that depends.
- What does it depend on?

96
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:15,193
On a lot of things.

97
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:21,125
If I told you I knew a place that had oil
where land could be bought cheaply,

98
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:24,000
what do you think that would be worth?

99
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:29,239
I think that you should let me know
what you know

100
00:20:29,344 --> 00:20:32,472
and then we'll try
and work something out.

101
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:36,643
- Can I sit down?
- Please.

102
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:50,094
What church do you belong to?

103
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:57,101
I...

104
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:02,766
I enjoy all faiths. I don't belong
to one church in particular.

105
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:06,904
I like them all. I like everything.
Where are you from?

106
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,883
That would be telling you.
That's what I want to sell you.

107
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:16,015
What are you doing in Signal Hill?

108
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,525
We have oil,
and it seeps through the ground.

109
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:20,185
Do you want to pay me
to know where it is?

110
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:21,353
Just 'cause there's something
on the ground

111
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:23,226
doesn't mean
there's anything beneath it.

112
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:26,062
Why did Standard Oil buy up land?

113
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,502
Is it in California?

114
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,568
- Maybe.
- How much land did they buy?

115
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,111
I'd like it better
if you didn't think I was stupid.

116
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,887
Why did you come to me?

117
00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:53,324
- You just brought this well in.
- That's right.

118
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:57,728
Yes, so just give me $500 in cash
right now

119
00:21:57,866 --> 00:22:00,300
and I'll tell you where it is.

120
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,666
I'll tell you what I'll do, son.
I'll give you $100 now,

121
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:07,401
and if it proves to be a promising lease,
then give you a $1,000 bonus.

122
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:09,477
Six hundred dollars.

123
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:15,181
Tell me one thing to help me decide.
What else have you got up there?

124
00:22:15,284 --> 00:22:16,979
What do you grow?

125
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,816
We have a big ranch,
but it's mostly rocks.

126
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,391
Plant things.
Nothing will grow but weeds.

127
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:24,719
What makes you think it's up?

128
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,920
Is there sulfur around?
Or alkali deposits?

129
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:31,089
Alkali nearby. I don't know sulfur.

130
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:39,470
Is that your son?

131
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:41,205
Yes.

132
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:43,806
- Hi.
- Hi.

133
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:49,848
- Who are you?
- I'm Fletcher Hamilton.

134
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:51,953
Nice to meet you, son.
What's your name?

135
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:53,681
What do you do?

136
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,783
I work with Mr. Plainview.

137
00:22:57,492 --> 00:22:59,221
Here's $500, son.

138
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:03,195
You tell me something worth hearing,
this money's yours.

139
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:11,037
I come from a town called Little Boston
in Isabella County.

140
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:17,645
This is us, here.
Spur station here at Little Boston.

141
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:20,738
The Sunday ranch
is what you're looking for.

142
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:23,079
There's a sheep trail
that takes you there.

143
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:26,154
It's a mile out of town headed west,
not far.

144
00:23:26,288 --> 00:23:30,190
Just through a small pass here
near the base of the hills.

145
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:34,022
You'll pass a church
and just follow the sheep trail.

146
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:38,292
- Where's Standard buying up?
- Here and here.

147
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:42,903
- Your family name is Sunday, yes?
- That's right.

148
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,472
How many's in your family?

149
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:47,803
My father and mother and sisters
and my brother Eli.

150
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:50,605
- How many sisters do you have?
- Two.

151
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:53,044
- What's your name?
- Paul.

152
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:56,379
Does any of your family know
about the oil that you say is there?

153
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:57,918
I don't know.

154
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,614
My uncle always said
there was oil there,

155
00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:03,224
but I don't know what they heard
or what they think.

156
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:04,758
What do you grow?

157
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:10,025
It's goats. It's a goat farm.
I told you, nothing grows but weeds.

158
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:12,623
- Is there water?
- It's salty.

159
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:16,135
You drill a well,
it's hard not to get saltwater.

160
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:21,407
The oil is there. I'm telling you.

161
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:29,245
- I want to go now, so...
- You can stay tonight.

162
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:33,445
- No, I want to go now. I want to leave.
- Listen, Paul.

163
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:40,091
If I travel all the way out there
and I find that you've been lying to me,

164
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,822
I'm going to find you and I'm going
to take more than my money back.

165
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:45,161
Is that all right with you?

166
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:47,497
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then.

167
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:52,366
- Nice luck to you. God bless.
- And to you, young man.

168
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:33,798
- There's someone coming.
- Thank you, Mary.

169
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:47,079
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

170
00:26:49,624 --> 00:26:52,889
My name's Daniel Plainview.
This is my son, H.W.

171
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:56,526
- Are you hunting?
- Hunting for quail.

172
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:59,498
We're told there might be a good place
to camp up near the Sunday ranch.

173
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:01,432
This is the Sunday ranch.
You can camp here.

174
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,266
- Thank you. Do you have water?
- Yes.

175
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:07,264
We heard there was an earthquake
up here a few days ago.

176
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:09,240
- Is that right?
- Yes.

177
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:13,774
- Your family?
- Yeah, all fine. Thank you.

178
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:18,853
- We have goat's milk, if you'd like.
- That would be fine.

179
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:21,856
Now,

180
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:27,819
if we set our tent away over there,
we'd be out of your way over there.

181
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:29,191
That's fine.

182
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:31,492
Ruth! Help these men
and bring them some water.

183
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,033
No! H.W.

184
00:27:34,936 --> 00:27:38,394
Mr. Plainview,
would you like that milk now?

185
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,601
- That would be fine. Thank you.
- Mary! Bring them some milk.

186
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,177
My family will help you set up your tent.

187
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,509
No, please.
We set ourselves on this camping trip.

188
00:27:46,615 --> 00:27:48,276
We have to do the camping.

189
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,781
Hurry up!

190
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:56,747
- Do you have bread?
- We have potatoes.

191
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,519
Potatoes would be nice, thank you.

192
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:00,094
I'll have them boil you up
some potatoes.

193
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:02,526
That's all right.
I thought maybe we'd make a fire.

194
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:04,861
I wanted to work with my son
on making a fire.

195
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:06,900
All right. My son, Eli, will bring you
some wood.

196
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:09,060
Thank you so much for your hospitality,
Mr. Sunday.

197
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:11,229
- Yes.
- And we'll be out of your way.

198
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:14,069
- We're just hunting for quail.
- Yes.

199
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:18,205
- I'm sorry we don't have any bread.
- No, no, no.

200
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:21,111
Corn doesn't fill out in the hills here.
It's mostly rock.

201
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:24,047
We don't have room to raise the grain.

202
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,848
Thank you, young lady.

203
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,710
My name is Eli.

204
00:28:58,053 --> 00:29:00,021
Yes, you're Eli Sunday.

205
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:02,421
Welcome.

206
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:07,822
- H.W.
- Eli.

207
00:29:13,134 --> 00:29:16,228
- You're hunting quail?
- That's right.

208
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:25,002
- We will bring dinner.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

209
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,289
Dad!

210
00:30:48,997 --> 00:30:50,726
Dad, look at my shoe.

211
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:19,853
That's earthquake oil. Set loose.

212
00:31:43,384 --> 00:31:44,681
<i>So...</i>

213
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:47,481
<i>So?</i>

214
00:31:48,356 --> 00:31:49,721
<i>So, so.</i>

215
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:53,824
<i>If there's anything here,</i>
<i>we take it to the sea.</i>

216
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:58,694
What we do is we build a pipeline
to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula,

217
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,324
it's about 100 miles,

218
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:04,337
and we do a deal with Union Oil.
This is what we do.

219
00:32:04,873 --> 00:32:07,842
Then we don't need the railroads
and their shipping costs anymore.

220
00:32:07,942 --> 00:32:09,341
You see?

221
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,204
Yeah.

222
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,950
- You see that?
- Yeah.

223
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:19,315
Then we're making money.
We're making the real money.

224
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,251
What we should be making.
Not just...

225
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:23,755
Not just throwing it away
on shipping costs.

226
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:26,019
Otherwise, it's just mud.

227
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:32,825
How much are we going to pay them?

228
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,191
Who's that?

229
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:39,703
The Sunday family.

230
00:32:40,275 --> 00:32:43,142
I'm not going to give them oil prices.

231
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,977
I'll give them quail prices.

232
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,348
If we could take a few minutes,

233
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:58,584
there's something I'd very much
like to talk with you about.

234
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:02,059
Mother, would you take the girls
outside, please?

235
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:17,039
I believe in plain speaking, so...

236
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:20,841
This is a beautiful ranch.
I love hunting for quail.

237
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:24,776
My boy has been sick, you know.
He needs fresh air.

238
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:28,117
Doctors all say
he needs plentiful fresh air.

239
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:30,925
So,

240
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:37,487
what would you say would be
a fair price for this lot, Abel?

241
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:41,193
- To buy this place?
- That's right.

242
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:48,004
Take a moment.

243
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,611
- I'm sorry. I don't know.
- Six dollars an acre.

244
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:59,153
Six dollars? Thank you, Eli.

245
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,984
And then with the improvements
to the ranch over the years at $500...

246
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,649
I'd like to offer you $3,700
for this ranch.

247
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,353
- That's $3,700.
- No.

248
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,595
The Lord has sent this man here, Eli.

249
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,189
Yes, I believe He has.

250
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:17,395
- My offer to you is $3,700.
- What is it that brought you here, sir?

251
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:20,267
The Good Lord's guidance.

252
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:21,706
- Now, of course, within that...
- What about our oil?

253
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,470
...we're going to develop a lease.

254
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:28,271
- What's that?
- What about our oil?

255
00:34:29,684 --> 00:34:31,117
What about it?

256
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,414
We have oil here.
That's worth something.

257
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:35,955
Do you have someone
who can drill for it?

258
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:37,991
- Do you think there's oil here?
- I know there is.

259
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:40,151
It's very expensive to drill.

260
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:42,456
To get it up and out of the ground.
You ever tried that before?

261
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:44,622
- How much is it?
- Costly.

262
00:34:44,732 --> 00:34:47,792
Well, our oil sits right up
on top of the ground.

263
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,565
I believe that's called seepage.

264
00:34:50,705 --> 00:34:52,195
Doesn't necessarily mean
there's anything underneath.

265
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,501
- What would you give us for it?
- I don't know.

266
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:57,544
- Something you don't know.
- That's right.

267
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,816
What would you like, Eli?

268
00:35:04,552 --> 00:35:06,850
Ten thousand dollars.

269
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:10,524
For what?

270
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:14,188
For my church.

271
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:25,628
That's good.

272
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:30,440
That's a good one.

273
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:33,080
Well...

274
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:37,944
If we decide to drill for oil
and if the well begins to produce,

275
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,747
I'll give your church
a $5,000 signing bonus.

276
00:35:39,854 --> 00:35:40,821
Ten thousand.

277
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:43,413
Do you want to find someone else
that's going to come here and drill, Eli?

278
00:35:43,524 --> 00:35:46,618
Make the investment and do
all the hard work that goes into it?

279
00:35:46,761 --> 00:35:50,629
I can just as easily hunt for quail
on another ranch as I can here, so...

280
00:35:50,765 --> 00:35:55,395
Though I'll happily be a supporter
of your church for as long as I can.

281
00:35:55,503 --> 00:35:57,300
For the bonus only.

282
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:02,907
Now, as it happens, I do have some
connections in the drilling business

283
00:36:03,011 --> 00:36:07,573
who might help get us started.
How do you feel about this, Abel?

284
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:09,582
Yes. What Eli says.

285
00:36:09,717 --> 00:36:12,880
Well, good! Let's draw up
some contracts and let's...

286
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:14,887
Let's give it a try.

287
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,090
Appreciate your help with this, Eli.

288
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:32,032
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

289
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,437
- Real estate?
- Yes.

290
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:35,565
Yes, I'd like to talk to you.

291
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:40,204
I'm looking for some land.
I just bought the Sunday ranch.

292
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:44,375
And, well, where's the map?

293
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,386
Where are the hills
behind the Sunday ranch?

294
00:36:47,522 --> 00:36:51,185
That's here. It's the Bandy tract.
He has over 600 acres.

295
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:55,353
Bandy, 600.

296
00:36:55,496 --> 00:37:01,958
- What about this?
- A.C. Maude, Blodget, Redlick, Carr.

297
00:37:03,671 --> 00:37:06,663
- What's it held at?
- Six dollars an acre.

298
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:08,705
Six.

299
00:37:08,843 --> 00:37:10,470
What about this?

300
00:37:10,578 --> 00:37:14,173
That's the Belvins,
and that could be got, I'm sure.

301
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:18,780
Can everything around here be got?

302
00:37:19,554 --> 00:37:21,021
Sure.

303
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,804
Paul Sunday turned out
to be a good friend of ours.

304
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,109
That's right.

305
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:57,447
Well, you get here just as soon
as you can. Bring Fred English.

306
00:37:58,826 --> 00:38:00,259
Good enough.

307
00:38:00,928 --> 00:38:02,657
Thank you, porter.

308
00:38:05,266 --> 00:38:07,894
- H.W., how are you?
- Fine, and you?

309
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:09,902
- Pretty good. Where's your dad?
- He's inside.

310
00:38:10,004 --> 00:38:11,403
You fellas are a long way
from Signal Hill.

311
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:13,474
- Hello, Plainview.
- Hello, Gene.

312
00:38:13,608 --> 00:38:16,099
- Good to see you.
- Charlie.

313
00:38:16,244 --> 00:38:20,772
- On your way somewhere else?
- Passing through. Looking around.

314
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:23,406
- Funny to see you.
- Funny, isn't it?

315
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,281
You boys are a regular family business.

316
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,081
You boys are a little late.

317
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:32,249
- What did you find?
- I found some interesting prospects.

318
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,621
Did you hear Standard bought up?

319
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:36,355
- Mostly in the north, so far.
- That's what I hear.

320
00:38:36,464 --> 00:38:39,900
I'm gonna tell you, Gene,
if you're gonna make a play, look east.

321
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:45,267
I'd rather it be you than someone else.
This mud around here has been taken.

322
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,933
It must be easy when you have such
a cute face to carry around with you.

323
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,136
- Telling me how handsome my son is?
- Well, that I am.

324
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,409
That's very nice. Thank you.
Good luck, Gene.

325
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,018
- Take care.
- Like I said, go east.

326
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,211
H.W.

327
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,916
I'll be your lawyer
if you need to draw up a contract.

328
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:07,323
Make sure you don't get swindled, boy.
Get half what your dad's making.

329
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,197
How's that?

330
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:36,316
What are those men doing?

331
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:41,184
They're just guys
that are working for us.

332
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:43,627
They're just looking around.

333
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:48,063
How much money can we make?

334
00:39:52,106 --> 00:39:54,472
I don't know. It depends.

335
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:00,772
One thousand dollars?

336
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:12,389
Mary said that her father beats her
if she doesn't pray.

337
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:21,400
Mary, she's the smaller one?

338
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:25,595
Yes, she is.

339
00:40:39,387 --> 00:40:41,912
- Everyone here?
- Very successful.

340
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,714
But?

341
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:47,225
There were a few vacant lots
and one holdout.

342
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,988
- Who?
- William Bandy.

343
00:40:49,096 --> 00:40:51,155
...eight. Who's he?

344
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:52,664
He's an old man
who homesteaded here.

345
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:55,895
Lives with his grandson.
He said he'd like to speak with you.

346
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,197
Is he here?

347
00:40:57,338 --> 00:41:00,364
No, he'd like you to come visit with him.

348
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:02,203
He's boosting his price.

349
00:41:02,343 --> 00:41:06,143
He said he'd like to speak
with whoever is doing the buying.

350
00:41:06,247 --> 00:41:09,512
Well, let him wait. He'll come around.
Let's go.

351
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,524
Ladies and gentlemen?

352
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:21,552
Ladies and gentlemen.

353
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:25,063
Thank you so much
for visiting with us this evening.

354
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,760
Now, I've traveled across half our state
to be here and to see about this land.

355
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,329
<i>Now, I daresay some of you</i>
<i>might have heard</i>

356
00:41:33,474 --> 00:41:37,308
<i>some of the more extravagant rumors</i>
<i>about what my plans are,</i>

357
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,175
<i>so I just thought</i>
<i>you'd like to hear it from me.</i>

358
00:41:40,314 --> 00:41:43,181
<i>This is the face. It's no great mystery.</i>

359
00:41:46,053 --> 00:41:50,012
<i>I'm an oilman, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

360
00:41:50,891 --> 00:41:54,292
<i>I have numerous concerns</i>
<i>spread across this state.</i>

361
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:57,796
<i>I have many wells flowing</i>
<i>at many thousand barrels per day,</i>

362
00:41:57,898 --> 00:42:00,867
<i>so I like to think of myself as an oilman.</i>

363
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:03,666
<i>As an oilman, I hope that you'll forgive</i>

364
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,672
<i>just good old-fashioned plain speaking.</i>

365
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:11,836
<i>Now, this work that we do</i>
<i>is very much a family enterprise.</i>

366
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:14,641
<i>I work side by side</i>
<i>with my wonderful son, H. W.</i>

367
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:17,980
<i>I think one or two of you</i>
<i>might have met him already.</i>

368
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:21,851
<i>And I encourage my men</i>
<i>to bring their families, as well.</i>

369
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:25,948
<i>Of course, it makes for an ever</i>
<i>so much more rewarding life for them.</i>

370
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:30,019
<i>Family means children,</i>
<i>and children means education.</i>

371
00:42:30,164 --> 00:42:33,827
<i>So, wherever we set up camp,</i>
<i>education is a necessity,</i>

372
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,163
<i>and we're just so happy</i>
<i>to take care of that.</i>

373
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,669
So let's build a wonderful school
in Little Boston.

374
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,001
These children are the future
that we strive for,

375
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,236
and so they should have
the very best of things.

376
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:46,336
Now, something else,

377
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,314
and please don't be insulted
if I speak about this. Bread.

378
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:52,419
Let's talk about bread.

379
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,453
Now, to my mind, it's an abomination
to consider

380
00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:00,788
that any man, woman, or child
in this magnificent country of ours

381
00:43:00,928 --> 00:43:04,386
should have to look upon
a loaf of bread as a luxury.

382
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:08,760
<i>We're going to dig water wells here,</i>
<i>and water wells means irrigation.</i>

383
00:43:08,903 --> 00:43:11,269
<i>Irrigation means cultivation.</i>

384
00:43:11,405 --> 00:43:15,273
<i>We're going to raise crops here where</i>
<i>before it just simply wasn't possible.</i>

385
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:17,809
<i>You're going to have more grain</i>
<i>than you'll know what to do with,</i>

386
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:20,880
<i>and bread will be coming right</i>
<i>out of your ears, ma'am.</i>

387
00:43:20,981 --> 00:43:26,283
<i>New roads, agriculture,</i>
<i>employment, education.</i>

388
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,388
These are just a few of the things
we can offer you,

389
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:30,457
and I assure you,
ladies and gentlemen,

390
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:32,752
that if we do find oil here,

391
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:36,294
and I think there's a very good chance
that we will,

392
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:40,924
this community of yours
will not only survive, it will flourish.

393
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:46,196
I'd be happy to answer any questions
that you might have. Yes?

394
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:48,832
Will the new road lead to the church?

395
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:53,380
That'll be the first place that it leads.
Thank you, Eli. Anyone else?

396
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,346
Well, if anything comes up,
I'm pretty easy to find.

397
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,712
You just come visit with me.

398
00:43:57,818 --> 00:43:59,843
Thank you so much for your time,
and good night.

399
00:44:38,392 --> 00:44:43,352
<i>What a privilege to carry</i>

400
00:44:43,497 --> 00:44:47,365
<i>everything to God in prayer!</i>

401
00:44:48,335 --> 00:44:51,896
<i>What a privilege to carry...</i>

402
00:45:09,256 --> 00:45:11,121
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

403
00:45:11,225 --> 00:45:13,455
The new road will lead you there.

404
00:45:13,561 --> 00:45:15,222
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

405
00:45:15,362 --> 00:45:18,889
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

406
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:20,728
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

407
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:23,166
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

408
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:26,330
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

409
00:45:35,182 --> 00:45:38,743
<i>Jesus knows our every weakness</i>

410
00:45:40,588 --> 00:45:43,523
<i>Take it to the Lord in prayer</i>

411
00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:48,922
<i>Are we weak and heavy-laden</i>

412
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:52,956
<i>Cumbered with a load of care?</i>

413
00:45:54,201 --> 00:45:57,295
<i>Precious Savior still our refuge</i>

414
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,934
<i>Take it to the Lord in prayer...</i>

415
00:46:13,954 --> 00:46:17,014
- Daniel, may I speak with you?
- Yes, come in.

416
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:22,128
I'll bring them up when they arrive.

417
00:46:22,262 --> 00:46:24,457
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

418
00:46:24,598 --> 00:46:26,498
How is all the work coming?

419
00:46:26,634 --> 00:46:28,067
Everything's good.

420
00:46:28,168 --> 00:46:31,296
- All the men are provided for?
- Of course.

421
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,239
Spirits seem high.

422
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:41,147
Is there anything
that you need from me?

423
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:48,483
- Anything the church can do for you?
- I don't believe so. No. Thank you.

424
00:46:48,622 --> 00:46:50,954
I understand you've asked the people
to gather around

425
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:52,683
and watch the well begin tomorrow.
Is that right?

426
00:46:52,793 --> 00:46:54,761
- That's right.
- I will bless the well.

427
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:59,226
Before you begin,
you should introduce me.

428
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:01,893
You'll see me walk up
towards the oil well, and when I...

429
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:03,060
The derrick.

430
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:06,970
You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say my name.

431
00:47:07,107 --> 00:47:09,234
When you walk up?

432
00:47:09,343 --> 00:47:13,245
Yes. You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say,

433
00:47:13,347 --> 00:47:18,478
"The proud son of these hills
who tended his Father's flock,"

434
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:21,119
and then you could say my name.

435
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:23,981
That's fine.

436
00:47:24,992 --> 00:47:28,393
- And what happens then?
- Well, then we start the drill.

437
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:35,194
It's a simple blessing, Daniel,
but an important one.

438
00:47:35,335 --> 00:47:38,304
It's just a few words. It won't take long.

439
00:47:39,406 --> 00:47:42,500
- What time?
- What time's good for you, Eli?

440
00:47:42,643 --> 00:47:45,441
- 4:00.
- Well, let's make it 4:00 then.

441
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:50,278
- My thanks for your visit.
- Good day. Thank you.

442
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:07,667
Afternoon, everyone.

443
00:48:09,002 --> 00:48:10,594
Come with me.

444
00:48:16,009 --> 00:48:19,467
I thank you all so much
for visiting with us at this time.

445
00:48:19,613 --> 00:48:21,410
I've had the pleasure of
meeting some of you

446
00:48:21,515 --> 00:48:23,346
and I hope very much
in the months to come,

447
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,647
I'll be able to visit with
each and every one of you.

448
00:48:26,787 --> 00:48:29,449
I'm better at digging holes in the
ground than making speeches,

449
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,114
so let's forget the speech
for this evening,

450
00:48:31,258 --> 00:48:33,158
just make it a simple blessing.

451
00:48:33,293 --> 00:48:35,056
You see, one man doesn't prospect
from the ground.

452
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:39,098
It takes a whole community of
good people, such as yourselves,

453
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:42,191
and this is good. We stay together.

454
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:44,065
We pray together, we work together,

455
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,140
and if the Good Lord smiles kindly
on our endeavor,

456
00:48:47,274 --> 00:48:49,742
we share in the wealth together.

457
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,238
Now, before we spud in
Mary's Well Number One,

458
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,511
named for the lovely
Miss Mary Sunday, here by my side,

459
00:48:57,618 --> 00:49:00,610
a proud daughter of these hills,

460
00:49:00,754 --> 00:49:04,451
I'd just like to say God bless these
honest labors of ours, and, of course,

461
00:49:04,591 --> 00:49:06,616
God bless you all.

462
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,852
Amen.

463
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:09,258
Now go.

464
00:49:14,234 --> 00:49:15,997
Won't be a minute.

465
00:49:19,072 --> 00:49:21,040
Fast as you can, H.W.

466
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,672
Are you ready to do this?

467
00:49:36,523 --> 00:49:38,991
That's it, ladies and gentlemen!

468
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:46,992
Al Rose has very generously provided
some refreshments for this occasion

469
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,830
out of his own pocket. Thank you, Al.

470
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:55,008
If you'll all just care to help yourselves,
I'll be back in a minute.

471
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,505
Mary.

472
00:51:11,184 --> 00:51:12,811
Mary Sunday.

473
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,386
- Do you like your new dress?
- Yes. Thank you.

474
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,393
You're welcome. I thought you'd like it.

475
00:51:22,262 --> 00:51:24,787
- Are you happy I came here?
- Yes.

476
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,197
Your daddy doesn't hit you anymore,
does he? Does he now?

477
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:32,936
Better not, right?

478
00:51:33,607 --> 00:51:35,598
I'll take care of you.

479
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:41,841
No more hitting, right?
No more hitting. Now go.

480
00:51:41,982 --> 00:51:45,008
Go and play some more
and don't come back.

481
00:51:54,161 --> 00:51:55,594
Daniel?

482
00:51:59,266 --> 00:52:03,430
It's okay, H.W. Go back to sleep.
Go on. Go back to sleep.

483
00:52:05,973 --> 00:52:07,133
Daniel.

484
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,737
Daniel.

485
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,942
Daniel!

486
00:52:16,516 --> 00:52:17,710
Daniel!

487
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:19,080
What?

488
00:52:20,954 --> 00:52:23,047
Lost a man down the well.

489
00:52:27,594 --> 00:52:29,721
- What man?
- Joe Gundha.

490
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,791
- Did I know him?
- No.

491
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:35,359
What happened?

492
00:52:43,043 --> 00:52:44,442
Pick it up.

493
00:52:45,112 --> 00:52:46,704
Set the brake.

494
00:52:46,813 --> 00:52:49,111
- Tie it down.
- Tie it on.

495
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,051
Shit!

496
00:52:57,124 --> 00:52:59,922
God damn it. Where's the body?

497
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,252
- They're fishing it out now.
- All right.

498
00:53:06,633 --> 00:53:09,261
- Where's the bit?
- It's on the deck.

499
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,646
Clean him up. Put some clothes on him.

500
00:53:56,783 --> 00:53:58,045
And...

501
00:53:59,686 --> 00:54:01,244
Set up a tent.

502
00:54:01,354 --> 00:54:05,313
Anyone goes down into the cellar,
you tell somebody. Yes?

503
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:07,358
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

504
00:54:11,298 --> 00:54:13,323
Shut down till midday.

505
00:54:44,631 --> 00:54:50,035
And I had a vision.
Yes, last night, I had a vision

506
00:54:50,137 --> 00:54:53,038
and I felt God's breath
move through me.

507
00:54:56,676 --> 00:55:00,772
And it rolled down into my stomach.

508
00:55:02,782 --> 00:55:04,647
It sloshed around.

509
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:09,920
And my stomach spoke in a whisper,
not a shout,

510
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,358
"Touch this woman with your hands
and caress her." Yes.

511
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,896
My dear Mrs. Hunter,

512
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,403
you have arthritis, don't you?

513
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:29,532
- Yes, I do, Eli.
- Yes.

514
00:55:29,643 --> 00:55:33,238
The devil is in your hands,
and I will suck it out.

515
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:38,874
Now, I will not cast this ghost out
with a fever

516
00:55:39,019 --> 00:55:44,047
for the new spirit inside me has shown
me I have a new way to communicate.

517
00:55:46,526 --> 00:55:48,551
It is a gentle whisper.

518
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,301
Get out of here, ghost.

519
00:55:59,873 --> 00:56:02,205
Get out of here, ghost.

520
00:56:04,244 --> 00:56:05,677
Get out.

521
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:09,180
Get out of here, ghost.

522
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:14,714
Get out of here, ghost.

523
00:56:14,854 --> 00:56:18,756
...and enter this woman's body now.
- Get out of here, ghost.

524
00:56:18,858 --> 00:56:23,693
Get out of here. Don't you dare turn
around and come back.

525
00:56:24,898 --> 00:56:26,593
For if you do,

526
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:32,195
all the armies of my boot
will kick you in the teeth

527
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:35,831
and you will be cast up
and thrown in the dirt

528
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:38,342
and thrust back to perdition!

529
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:42,175
And as long as I have teeth,
I will bite you,

530
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:46,274
and if I have no teeth, I will gum you!

531
00:56:46,386 --> 00:56:50,117
And as long as I have fists,
I will bash you!

532
00:56:50,223 --> 00:56:54,956
Now, get out of here, ghost!
Get out of here, ghost!

533
00:56:55,095 --> 00:56:58,121
Get out of here, ghost!

534
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:02,893
And it left!

535
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,661
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

536
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:09,641
- Praise the Lord and his holy days!
- Praise God!

537
00:57:09,776 --> 00:57:13,212
- Amen! Thank you.
- Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, God.

538
00:57:14,481 --> 00:57:16,642
My dear Mrs. Hunter.

539
00:57:20,253 --> 00:57:21,982
Dance with me.

540
00:57:29,229 --> 00:57:31,561
- Thanks for coming.
- It was a wonderful sermon.

541
00:57:31,665 --> 00:57:34,065
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- Yes.

542
00:57:39,072 --> 00:57:40,039
Eli.

543
00:57:42,609 --> 00:57:45,407
Had a tragedy at the well last night.

544
00:57:46,646 --> 00:57:48,341
Yes, I heard.

545
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:50,848
Joe Gundha was a man
of considerable faith.

546
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:55,182
So if you wish to say a few words,
his burial is at noon tomorrow.

547
00:57:55,288 --> 00:57:58,121
Daniel, this accident
could have been avoided.

548
00:57:58,258 --> 00:58:00,351
It is terrible to think of that well

549
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,325
- working away out there...
- These men work in 12-hour shifts.

550
00:58:02,429 --> 00:58:03,418
...unblessed.
- They need their rest.

551
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,292
If they don't have it,
they start to make stupid mistakes.

552
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,162
I've seen the men drinking. Don't you
think that has something to do with this?

553
00:58:08,268 --> 00:58:09,735
We need these men well-rested
to bring in this well.

554
00:58:09,869 --> 00:58:12,030
They can't get that if they're up here
listening to your gospel,

555
00:58:12,138 --> 00:58:14,265
and then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

556
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,375
I wish I had more time with Joe Gundha.

557
00:58:16,509 --> 00:58:17,703
More could have been done.

558
00:58:17,844 --> 00:58:22,838
Then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

559
00:58:29,189 --> 00:58:31,487
Now, would you see to it
that his personal possessions

560
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,718
find their way
back to his family, please?

561
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,327
Thank you.

562
00:58:35,862 --> 00:58:38,990
Heard you were planning
some renovations.

563
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:42,068
Yes, our congregation
is growing strongly.

564
00:58:42,736 --> 00:58:47,196
- We need more room.
- That was one goddamn hell of a show.

565
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:50,866
We were happy to have you, Daniel.

566
01:00:44,491 --> 01:00:46,220
Gas, gas, gas!

567
01:00:55,301 --> 01:00:58,395
Lights out! Wait here. Wait here.
Lights out!

568
01:01:08,548 --> 01:01:10,345
Put that fire out!

569
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:40,976
Is he hurt? H.W.!
Hand him down to me!

570
01:01:45,552 --> 01:01:47,782
- Hand him down!
- Here.

571
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:54,018
- Got him?
- I've got him!

572
01:02:01,334 --> 01:02:02,699
Oh, God.

573
01:02:18,117 --> 01:02:19,516
Come on.

574
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:33,222
Open the door.

575
01:02:48,047 --> 01:02:50,777
Let go. There you go. You're safe.
You're safe.

576
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:55,585
You're safe now. I got you here.
You're safe. Let go, son.

577
01:02:56,956 --> 01:02:59,823
Tell me where it hurts.
Tell me where it hurts. Tell me where...

578
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:01,426
- Did you see this?
- No.

579
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:02,585
Tell me where it hurts.

580
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:05,255
Where does it hurt you?
Where does it hurt you?

581
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:09,028
- I can't hear my voice.
- Were you hit in the head?

582
01:03:09,736 --> 01:03:14,264
Were you hit in the head? Tell me!
You have to tell me if you were!

583
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:16,399
I can't hear my voice.

584
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:28,115
I have to go and deal with this now.
You wait here for me.

585
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:32,055
You understand? You wait here for me.
I'll be back. I'll be back in a minute.

586
01:03:32,158 --> 01:03:33,318
- Wait here.
- Don't leave!

587
01:03:33,459 --> 01:03:37,896
I'm going to take care of you. Wait.
Stay here, son. I'm going to fix this.

588
01:03:37,997 --> 01:03:38,895
- Don't leave!
- You're going to be fine!

589
01:03:38,998 --> 01:03:39,987
Wait for me here!

590
01:03:40,099 --> 01:03:43,091
- Hold him down. Hold him down.
- Don't leave!

591
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:47,966
Got to break the cables, Daniel!

592
01:03:48,107 --> 01:03:49,972
Get me a hammer!

593
01:03:56,282 --> 01:03:58,113
Get me a hammer!

594
01:04:00,687 --> 01:04:02,382
Here you go.

595
01:04:27,714 --> 01:04:29,045
Get back!

596
01:05:06,686 --> 01:05:07,983
- Michael!
- Sir!

597
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:10,521
Take Dave and two of the fellas,
pick up some hoses...

598
01:05:10,623 --> 01:05:14,559
Billy, protect the roof.
Don't wait before it gets too hot.

599
01:05:36,949 --> 01:05:39,577
What are you looking
so miserable about?

600
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:42,552
There's a whole ocean of oil
under our feet!

601
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:45,350
No one can get at it except for me.

602
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,663
H.W. Okay?

603
01:06:34,674 --> 01:06:36,232
No, he isn't.

604
01:06:38,511 --> 01:06:40,843
- Where is he?
- Mess room.

605
01:08:20,046 --> 01:08:23,675
That's enough now.
That's enough, H.W. That's enough.

606
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:29,378
Do you hear me?
Can you hear me in there?

607
01:08:35,161 --> 01:08:36,856
That's enough.

608
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,972
- Grab his legs.
- I have his legs.

609
01:08:52,078 --> 01:08:53,978
- No. Nope.
- No, lad.

610
01:08:59,652 --> 01:09:01,313
Give me that.

611
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,616
Steady. That's it.

612
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:09,126
- Easy, boy. Easy.
- Soon be over.

613
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:12,994
Yeah, and that's good.
Now the other side. Turn him over.

614
01:09:16,936 --> 01:09:17,903
Almost done.

615
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:22,907
That's it.

616
01:09:23,776 --> 01:09:26,574
Come here. It's over. It's over.

617
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:35,500
Who do we know in San Francisco

618
01:11:37,076 --> 01:11:39,840
or Los Angeles, who could work with...

619
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:46,112
You know, we could...
Someone, a teacher for H.W.

620
01:11:50,456 --> 01:11:52,788
How could you figure out that?

621
01:11:53,659 --> 01:11:57,652
Now, call...
God damn it, what's his name?

622
01:11:57,797 --> 01:12:00,095
Bob Brody in San Francisco?

623
01:12:01,267 --> 01:12:04,327
Call Bob Brody
and get someone down here.

624
01:12:10,943 --> 01:12:12,843
I'll do it right away.

625
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,743
When do we get our money, Daniel?

626
01:13:28,788 --> 01:13:32,315
Aren't you a healer?
And a vessel for the Holy Spirit?

627
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:35,450
When are you coming over
and make my son hear again?

628
01:13:35,595 --> 01:13:36,721
Can't you do that?

629
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,797
If you had let me bless the well,
this wouldn't have happened.

630
01:13:38,931 --> 01:13:41,729
- Daniel.
- You shouldn't have done that.

631
01:13:43,102 --> 01:13:47,402
You owe the Church of
the Third Revelation $5,000

632
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:50,373
as part of the arrangement
that we made!

633
01:14:00,152 --> 01:14:04,953
Don't even try it, you little runt!
You splash around in here.

634
01:14:11,831 --> 01:14:13,731
That's it, that's it.

635
01:14:25,811 --> 01:14:28,473
I'm going to bury you underground, Eli.

636
01:14:32,518 --> 01:14:35,112
I'm going to bury you underground.

637
01:15:06,686 --> 01:15:09,450
You are a stupid man, Abel.

638
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:15,920
You've let someone come in here
and walk all over us.

639
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:22,557
You let him in and do his work here,

640
01:15:22,668 --> 01:15:26,661
and you are a stupid man
for what we could have had.

641
01:15:26,806 --> 01:15:30,742
I followed His word, Eli. I tried.

642
01:15:30,843 --> 01:15:33,573
You didn't do anything but sit down.

643
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:37,415
You're lazy, and you're stupid.

644
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,250
Do you think God is going
to save you for being stupid?

645
01:15:47,927 --> 01:15:50,487
He doesn't save stupid people, Abel.

646
01:15:53,866 --> 01:15:58,303
I will tear you apart for
what you've done, you stupid man!

647
01:15:58,437 --> 01:16:00,735
How did he come here?
Do you really know? I know!

648
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,468
- Son, don't do this, please!
- Be quiet!

649
01:16:03,609 --> 01:16:08,637
Shut your mouth, Abel!
It was your stupid son!

650
01:16:08,781 --> 01:16:12,717
It was Paul who told him to come here.
I know it.

651
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,547
He went to him and he said,

652
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:19,386
"My stupid, weak father
will give away his lots.

653
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:22,950
"Go and take him."
And you let it happen.

654
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,628
A stupid father to a stupid son.

655
01:16:36,275 --> 01:16:37,936
Get out of there!

656
01:17:08,641 --> 01:17:10,268
Can I help you?

657
01:17:11,844 --> 01:17:13,368
Daniel?

658
01:17:13,479 --> 01:17:17,210
- Who's that?
- My name is Henry.

659
01:17:18,184 --> 01:17:19,583
Yeah?

660
01:17:20,753 --> 01:17:22,152
I'm Henry.

661
01:17:23,689 --> 01:17:25,714
What can I do for you?

662
01:17:28,594 --> 01:17:32,394
I'm Henry Plainview.
I'm from Fond du Lac.

663
01:17:34,934 --> 01:17:38,768
I'm your brother, from another mother.

664
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,940
Ernest is my father.

665
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:48,770
Who are you?

666
01:17:50,149 --> 01:17:51,377
Henry.

667
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:22,904
- Mary Branch? Is that your mother?
- Yes, sir, that's right.

668
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:30,315
I read about your gusher in the paper,
about your success.

669
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:33,482
You heard about my strike?
You just show up?

670
01:18:34,527 --> 01:18:36,290
Our father's dead.

671
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:41,127
Ernest died, I heard.
I wanted to find you.

672
01:18:41,267 --> 01:18:42,894
When?

673
01:18:43,002 --> 01:18:46,597
Three months ago.
I got a letter from Annabelle.

674
01:18:47,606 --> 01:18:49,471
My sister, Annabelle?

675
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:55,140
- Where is she?
- Still at home. Fond du Lac.

676
01:18:56,882 --> 01:19:00,340
You came all the way
from Wisconsin to tell me this?

677
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:03,512
I'm coming from New Mexico.
I've been there.

678
01:19:04,723 --> 01:19:06,588
I came to find you.

679
01:19:07,726 --> 01:19:09,785
Did you know about me?

680
01:19:17,903 --> 01:19:20,098
Do you have identification?

681
01:19:20,773 --> 01:19:22,866
Do you have this letter?

682
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:48,090
- Where are you coming from?
- From New Mexico.

683
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,135
Yes, I know, but from where?

684
01:19:50,135 --> 01:19:50,658
Yes, I know, but from where?

685
01:19:50,803 --> 01:19:53,829
Silver City.
I've been there for two years.

686
01:19:54,907 --> 01:19:59,708
I was trying drilling of my own for years.

687
01:19:59,845 --> 01:20:06,250
- Getting leases in Texas. Louisiana.
- Anything that produced?

688
01:20:06,352 --> 01:20:09,344
No. Not like your success, no.

689
01:20:15,861 --> 01:20:18,295
- Are you married?
- No.

690
01:20:18,797 --> 01:20:22,790
I spent time in jail.
I had a stretch of very bad time.

691
01:20:23,469 --> 01:20:26,666
I had nothing.
I was picked up in Louisiana.

692
01:20:28,173 --> 01:20:31,802
I worked on a chain gang
for six months building roads.

693
01:20:32,344 --> 01:20:35,507
That was a very hard time.

694
01:20:39,284 --> 01:20:41,081
Are you married?

695
01:20:42,354 --> 01:20:44,788
What were you in jail for?

696
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:49,418
Believe it or not, for all the
terrible things I've gotten myself into,

697
01:20:49,528 --> 01:20:53,055
when they picked me up,
I hadn't done anything.

698
01:20:53,165 --> 01:20:56,965
But I've done my share of things

699
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,671
that shouldn't be talked about.

700
01:21:24,163 --> 01:21:27,223
Drink it. Drink it!

701
01:22:09,808 --> 01:22:11,105
Come on.

702
01:22:42,775 --> 01:22:44,072
So...

703
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,644
What do you want, Henry?

704
01:22:53,085 --> 01:22:54,484
Nothing.

705
01:22:57,623 --> 01:23:01,787
If you can spare something,
I can work for you in any way.

706
01:23:01,927 --> 01:23:06,227
I know I'll keep moving, before long,
to get back to Fond du Lac.

707
01:23:07,266 --> 01:23:09,598
- Do you have any money?
- Some.

708
01:23:10,702 --> 01:23:12,863
- Not much.
- Just answer me directly.

709
01:23:12,971 --> 01:23:16,566
You say "nothing," then you say
you'd like to stay and work.

710
01:23:16,675 --> 01:23:21,612
And it's better, I'd just like to hear
you say you'd like to be here.

711
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:24,648
I'd like to be here.

712
01:23:29,988 --> 01:23:35,585
I'm a good worker.
I worked cable tool rigs, built railroads.

713
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:39,788
I won't need any favors.

714
01:23:44,803 --> 01:23:45,929
Good.

715
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,958
<i>What did my mother know?</i>

716
01:24:16,568 --> 01:24:18,229
<i>I don't know.</i>

717
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:23,332
<i>I don't know if she knew and looked</i>
<i>the other way, if she never knew.</i>

718
01:24:26,078 --> 01:24:27,841
<i>Why did you leave?</i>

719
01:24:29,781 --> 01:24:32,750
<i>I know you didn't get on with our father.</i>

720
01:24:37,956 --> 01:24:41,687
I worked for Geological Survey
and went to Kansas.

721
01:24:44,129 --> 01:24:47,155
I couldn't stay there. I just couldn't.

722
01:24:48,901 --> 01:24:51,426
I don't like to explain myself.

723
01:24:57,476 --> 01:25:01,708
- Are you an angry man, Henry?
- About what?

724
01:25:02,547 --> 01:25:06,313
Are you envious? Do you get envious?

725
01:25:07,619 --> 01:25:09,553
I don't think so, no.

726
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:16,358
I have a competition in me.

727
01:25:17,596 --> 01:25:19,996
I want no one else to succeed.

728
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:29,531
- I hate most people.
- That part of me is gone.

729
01:25:30,776 --> 01:25:33,643
Working and not succeeding,

730
01:25:33,745 --> 01:25:37,738
all my failures have left me...

731
01:25:40,786 --> 01:25:42,651
I just don't care.

732
01:25:44,356 --> 01:25:46,950
Well, if it's in me, it's in you.

733
01:25:48,493 --> 01:25:53,897
There are times when I look at people
and I see nothing worth liking.

734
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:03,932
I want to earn enough money
I can get away from everyone.

735
01:26:08,981 --> 01:26:11,449
What will you do about your boy?

736
01:26:19,191 --> 01:26:20,818
I don't know.

737
01:26:22,361 --> 01:26:24,795
Maybe it'll change.

738
01:26:24,963 --> 01:26:29,366
Does your sound come back to you?
I don't know. Maybe no one knows that.

739
01:26:29,501 --> 01:26:33,665
- Doctor might not know that.
- Where's his mother?

740
01:26:39,644 --> 01:26:42,670
I don't want to talk about those things.

741
01:26:46,018 --> 01:26:48,248
I see the worst in people, Henry.

742
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:54,122
I don't need to look past seeing them
to get all I need.

743
01:26:56,294 --> 01:27:00,253
I've built up my hatreds over the years,
little by little.

744
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:07,302
Having you here
gives me a second breath of life.

745
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:11,134
I can't keep doing this on my own

746
01:27:14,446 --> 01:27:19,509
with these people.

747
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:01,882
Daniel! Daniel, wake up! Daniel!

748
01:29:44,229 --> 01:29:47,687
Just have to go and have a word
with the conductor.

749
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:50,559
I'll be right back.

750
01:29:50,702 --> 01:29:55,401
You stay here. You understand?
You stay here.

751
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:58,305
I'll be right back.

752
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:52,860
No! No!

753
01:30:54,566 --> 01:30:55,794
No!

754
01:31:05,644 --> 01:31:07,168
- Tilford!
- Plainview.

755
01:31:07,312 --> 01:31:09,610
This is my brother,
Henry Plainview from Fond du Lac.

756
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:11,341
H.M. Tilford. Pleasure.

757
01:31:11,483 --> 01:31:13,951
Henry Plainview. J.J. Carter.

758
01:31:15,987 --> 01:31:17,352
So...

759
01:31:17,489 --> 01:31:19,116
- Shall we?
- Yes.

760
01:31:27,299 --> 01:31:29,494
How's your boy?

761
01:31:29,634 --> 01:31:33,001
- Thank you for asking.
- Is there anything we can do?

762
01:31:33,138 --> 01:31:35,538
Thanks for asking is enough.

763
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:39,199
So what are your plans?

764
01:31:40,979 --> 01:31:44,210
Is this about buying up my tracts here?

765
01:31:44,349 --> 01:31:45,407
Yes.

766
01:31:45,517 --> 01:31:48,350
The cable was
about my Coyote Hills lease.

767
01:31:48,486 --> 01:31:52,650
- We'd like that, too.
- What's your offer on Coyote Hills?

768
01:31:52,791 --> 01:31:57,353
- We'll offer 150,000 for full title.
- That's a deal. What's next?

769
01:31:58,196 --> 01:32:02,758
You have 11,000 acres in Little Boston.
You have one proven well

770
01:32:02,867 --> 01:32:04,357
- that was damaged...
- I have three wells proven.

771
01:32:04,502 --> 01:32:08,563
You haven't been paying attention.
That's three proven wells.

772
01:32:12,844 --> 01:32:14,744
We'll make you a millionaire
while you're sitting here

773
01:32:14,846 --> 01:32:17,178
from one minute to the next.

774
01:32:19,017 --> 01:32:21,781
And what else would I do with myself?

775
01:32:23,521 --> 01:32:27,890
- Are you asking me?
- What else would I do with myself?

776
01:32:28,526 --> 01:32:30,619
Take care of your son.

777
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:34,765
I don't know what you would do.

778
01:32:37,369 --> 01:32:39,837
If you were me and Standard
offered to buy what you had

779
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:42,633
for a million dollars, why? So, why?

780
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:44,967
You know why.

781
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:46,941
Yeah, you fellas
should just scratch around in the dirt

782
01:32:47,045 --> 01:32:50,481
and find it like the rest of us, instead of
buying up someone else's hard work.

783
01:32:50,615 --> 01:32:52,549
I've scratched around the dirt, son.

784
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:54,641
You going to change
your shipping costs?

785
01:32:54,786 --> 01:32:57,755
We don't dictate shipping costs.
That's railroad business.

786
01:32:58,790 --> 01:33:01,418
You don't own the railroads?

787
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:07,990
'Course you do. Of course you do.

788
01:33:09,701 --> 01:33:12,135
Where you going to put it all?

789
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:14,604
Where?

790
01:33:16,441 --> 01:33:20,434
Build a pipeline? Make a deal
with Union Oil? Be my guest.

791
01:33:20,578 --> 01:33:22,239
But if you can't pull it off,

792
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:26,443
you've got an ocean of oil
under your feet with nowhere to go.

793
01:33:27,452 --> 01:33:32,082
Why not turn it over to us?
We'll make you rich.

794
01:33:32,223 --> 01:33:34,521
You spend time with your boy.

795
01:33:35,593 --> 01:33:37,720
It's a great discovery.

796
01:33:38,663 --> 01:33:40,756
Now, let us help you.

797
01:33:49,974 --> 01:33:53,068
Did you just tell me
how to run my family?

798
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:55,406
It might be more important now
that you've proven the field

799
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:57,412
and we're offering to buy you out.

800
01:33:57,549 --> 01:33:59,744
One night I'm going to come to you,
inside of your house,

801
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:02,853
or wherever you're sleeping,
and I'm going to cut your throat.

802
01:34:02,954 --> 01:34:04,114
What?

803
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:06,151
What are you talking about?
Have you gone crazy?

804
01:34:06,257 --> 01:34:07,554
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard what you said,

805
01:34:07,692 --> 01:34:10,160
- why did you say it?
- You don't tell me about my son.

806
01:34:10,261 --> 01:34:12,456
Why are you acting insane
and threatening to cut my throat?

807
01:34:12,564 --> 01:34:15,624
- You don't tell me about my son.
- I'm not telling you anything!

808
01:34:15,733 --> 01:34:19,533
I'm asking you to be reasonable.
If I've offended you, I apologize.

809
01:34:19,671 --> 01:34:21,832
You'll see what I can do.

810
01:34:29,614 --> 01:34:33,812
This parcel here is the 3,000-acre
ranch owned by B.L. Harper.

811
01:34:33,952 --> 01:34:36,443
This is San Luis Obispo County land.

812
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:38,419
And from here to the coast,
it's all Union Oil.

813
01:34:38,523 --> 01:34:41,651
What's this? Why don't I own this?

814
01:34:44,629 --> 01:34:49,157
- Why don't I own this?
- That's the Bandy tract.

815
01:34:49,968 --> 01:34:53,131
He was the holdout,
when we were doing the buying.

816
01:34:53,238 --> 01:34:55,672
He had hoped to speak with you.

817
01:34:59,878 --> 01:35:03,370
Can't you just build the pipeline
around this tract?

818
01:35:06,351 --> 01:35:10,412
Can I build around 50 miles
of Tehachapi mountains?

819
01:35:10,555 --> 01:35:13,080
Don't be thick in front of me, Al.

820
01:35:13,725 --> 01:35:17,422
- I can go to him again.
- No, I'll go and talk to the man.

821
01:35:17,562 --> 01:35:20,463
I'll talk to him. Show you how it's done.

822
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:26,736
All right. Pack it up, Henry.

823
01:35:37,081 --> 01:35:40,983
- How big is his room?
- He's sharing with another boy.

824
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:43,952
- Who?
- An older boy. About 12.

825
01:35:44,055 --> 01:35:47,081
He's been there for a year.
Named Ballard.

826
01:35:52,297 --> 01:35:56,700
- How big is the room?
- It's a fair size. Got enough space.

827
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:02,234
Are you taking Henry with you
to meet Union Oil?

828
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,081
- Are you the son of William Bandy?
- Grandson.

829
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:20,953
- Is he here?
- No, he's out.

830
01:36:21,092 --> 01:36:22,150
Where is he?

831
01:36:22,293 --> 01:36:25,160
Told you, he's out.
Now, what do you want?

832
01:36:28,666 --> 01:36:32,602
I'm Daniel Plainview. I want to talk
with him about his property.

833
01:36:32,704 --> 01:36:37,573
- About what?
- I believe I'll talk with him about that.

834
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:40,476
- You're that oilman, aren't you?
- That's right.

835
01:36:40,612 --> 01:36:42,580
We don't want you drilling out here.

836
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:46,081
I don't want it either.
Now, when will he be back?

837
01:36:46,184 --> 01:36:47,242
Few days.

838
01:36:47,352 --> 01:36:49,946
Tell him I'd like to speak with him.
Not about drilling.

839
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:52,284
And I'll be back in a week.

840
01:39:11,395 --> 01:39:13,522
Put that in a glass case.

841
01:39:14,432 --> 01:39:16,297
Here's to Union Oil.

842
01:39:17,001 --> 01:39:18,059
Hundred miles of pipeline,

843
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:20,636
and all the independent producers
of this great state.

844
01:39:20,738 --> 01:39:21,705
Cheers.

845
01:39:46,864 --> 01:39:49,560
<i>There's that house in Fond du Lac</i>

846
01:39:51,469 --> 01:39:54,734
<i>that John Hollister built.</i>
<i>Do you remember it?</i>

847
01:39:57,608 --> 01:40:01,044
I thought as a boy that was
the most beautiful house I'd ever seen,

848
01:40:01,145 --> 01:40:02,772
and I wanted it.

849
01:40:03,514 --> 01:40:05,982
I wanted to live in it.

850
01:40:06,117 --> 01:40:07,641
And eat in it.

851
01:40:08,519 --> 01:40:10,111
And clean it.

852
01:40:13,124 --> 01:40:17,424
And even as a boy, I wanted
to have children to run around in it.

853
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:21,860
You can have
anything you'd like now, Daniel.

854
01:40:22,567 --> 01:40:24,194
And you should.

855
01:40:24,969 --> 01:40:29,633
- Where are you going to build it?
- Here, maybe. Near the ocean.

856
01:40:32,543 --> 01:40:35,307
Would you make it look like that house?

857
01:40:40,051 --> 01:40:43,509
I think if I saw that house now,
it'd make me sick.

858
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:52,429
We can eat and get some women.

859
01:40:55,399 --> 01:40:57,526
Take them to the Peachtree dance.

860
01:41:01,272 --> 01:41:05,208
I say get liquored up and take them
to the Peachtree dance.

861
01:41:08,112 --> 01:41:09,340
Yeah.

862
01:42:28,292 --> 01:42:30,692
Can I have some money, please?

863
01:42:38,102 --> 01:42:40,502
Can I have some money, please?

864
01:43:29,587 --> 01:43:32,078
I want you to tell me something.

865
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:36,920
What?

866
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:41,420
What's the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

867
01:43:52,476 --> 01:43:57,140
What was the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

868
01:44:00,684 --> 01:44:03,676
- I can't remember...
- Who are you?

869
01:44:06,624 --> 01:44:08,524
I'll leave, Daniel.

870
01:44:10,294 --> 01:44:11,852
Who are you?

871
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:16,723
I'm no one.

872
01:44:17,802 --> 01:44:20,066
Just let me get up and go.

873
01:44:22,573 --> 01:44:24,438
Do I have a brother?

874
01:44:28,412 --> 01:44:33,611
I met a man in King City
who said he was your brother.

875
01:44:36,153 --> 01:44:39,247
We were friends for months.

876
01:44:40,724 --> 01:44:42,658
Working in King City.

877
01:44:44,895 --> 01:44:47,762
And he wanted
to make his way to you, Daniel.

878
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:51,160
We didn't have any money.

879
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:58,304
He died of tuberculosis.

880
01:44:59,743 --> 01:45:01,574
He wasn't harmed.

881
01:45:02,613 --> 01:45:04,843
Wasn't killed, nothing bad.

882
01:45:06,684 --> 01:45:08,948
But he told me about you,

883
01:45:11,989 --> 01:45:14,287
and I just took his story,

884
01:45:17,995 --> 01:45:19,792
used his diary.

885
01:45:23,434 --> 01:45:24,401
Daniel.

886
01:45:26,036 --> 01:45:29,369
Daniel, I'm your friend.

887
01:45:31,575 --> 01:45:34,009
I'm not trying to hurt you.

888
01:45:34,145 --> 01:45:35,373
Never.

889
01:45:36,514 --> 01:45:38,038
Just survive.

890
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:39,810
No!

891
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,907
Who is it?

892
01:48:52,209 --> 01:48:53,676
I'm Bandy.

893
01:49:06,457 --> 01:49:08,322
Yes. Yes.

894
01:49:10,828 --> 01:49:12,557
William Bandy.

895
01:49:15,766 --> 01:49:18,394
Yeah, I'd like to lease your land.

896
01:49:20,838 --> 01:49:24,399
I had asked for you
to come and talk to me before.

897
01:49:24,508 --> 01:49:26,772
When you were leasing land.

898
01:49:28,011 --> 01:49:29,808
That's right, yes.

899
01:49:31,515 --> 01:49:34,040
My boy's been very sick, you know.

900
01:49:35,185 --> 01:49:37,710
This was before your boy got sick.

901
01:49:40,824 --> 01:49:45,352
Now, I know
that you would like to build a pipeline

902
01:49:45,496 --> 01:49:48,158
through my property.

903
01:49:48,265 --> 01:49:52,395
- Is that right, what I've heard?
- It's absolutely right. And,

904
01:49:53,103 --> 01:49:54,070
well...

905
01:49:55,372 --> 01:49:58,603
Eight inch pipe.
It could be buried with your consent.

906
01:49:58,742 --> 01:50:01,267
I guarantee you
absolutely no disruption...

907
01:50:01,412 --> 01:50:02,572
God.

908
01:50:04,448 --> 01:50:07,076
God has told me what you must do.

909
01:50:11,455 --> 01:50:13,184
And what is that?

910
01:50:14,158 --> 01:50:18,060
You should be washed
in the blood of Jesus Christ.

911
01:50:19,863 --> 01:50:21,797
But I am.

912
01:50:23,333 --> 01:50:26,029
I have been washed, Mr. Bandy.
I have been.

913
01:50:26,170 --> 01:50:31,870
It's your only way to salvation.
And your only way for what you want.

914
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:37,271
You can take it at
the Church of the Third Revelation.

915
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:41,684
I'll pay you $3,000.

916
01:50:44,321 --> 01:50:47,085
I'd like you to be part of our church.

917
01:50:48,992 --> 01:50:50,892
I'll pay you $5,000.

918
01:50:51,995 --> 01:50:53,462
Be baptized.

919
01:50:54,832 --> 01:50:58,666
Be forgiven for the sin that you've done.

920
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:07,809
What sin are you referring to,
Mr. Bandy?

921
01:51:08,979 --> 01:51:10,881
My sin of drilling?

922
01:52:01,565 --> 01:52:05,558
<i>I truly wish everyone could be saved,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

923
01:52:05,702 --> 01:52:07,602
<i>Yes.</i>

924
01:52:07,738 --> 01:52:10,434
<i>I am afraid that's just not the case.</i>

925
01:52:11,308 --> 01:52:15,802
The doctrine of universal salvation
is a lie, is it not?

926
01:52:15,946 --> 01:52:18,574
- It's a lie.
- It's a lie.

927
01:52:18,682 --> 01:52:23,449
I wish everyone could be saved,
but they won't. No, they won't.

928
01:52:23,587 --> 01:52:27,045
You will never be saved if you...

929
01:52:27,157 --> 01:52:29,125
Reject the blood.

930
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:31,120
Good.

931
01:52:32,195 --> 01:52:36,655
Now, is there a sinner here
looking for salvation?

932
01:52:39,336 --> 01:52:40,928
A new member?

933
01:52:45,409 --> 01:52:47,172
I'll ask it again.

934
01:52:49,179 --> 01:52:51,875
Is there a sinner here looking for God?

935
01:52:52,015 --> 01:52:53,175
Yes.

936
01:52:57,287 --> 01:52:58,720
Allow me.

937
01:53:00,958 --> 01:53:03,722
Thank you for coming, brother Daniel.

938
01:53:05,829 --> 01:53:07,490
Thank you, Eli.

939
01:53:08,632 --> 01:53:13,729
We have a sinner with us here
who wishes for salvation!

940
01:53:13,837 --> 01:53:17,432
- Daniel, are you a sinner?
- Yes.

941
01:53:17,541 --> 01:53:20,237
The Lord can't hear you, Daniel.

942
01:53:20,344 --> 01:53:24,178
Say it to him. Go ahead
and speak to him. It's all right.

943
01:53:24,982 --> 01:53:27,280
- Yes.
- Down on your knees.

944
01:53:27,384 --> 01:53:28,942
Pray to him.

945
01:53:30,354 --> 01:53:34,723
Look up to the sky and say it.

946
01:53:37,327 --> 01:53:39,488
What do you want me to say?

947
01:53:40,530 --> 01:53:45,024
Daniel, you've come here and
you've brought good and wealth,

948
01:53:45,135 --> 01:53:49,333
but you have also brought
your bad habits as a backslider.

949
01:53:49,439 --> 01:53:53,705
You've lusted after women,
and you have abandoned your child.

950
01:53:53,810 --> 01:53:56,870
Your child, that you raised,
you have abandoned

951
01:53:56,980 --> 01:53:59,414
all because he was sick
and you have sinned.

952
01:53:59,549 --> 01:54:01,710
So say it now. I am a sinner.

953
01:54:01,818 --> 01:54:03,718
- I am a sinner.
- Say it louder.

954
01:54:03,820 --> 01:54:06,550
- I am a sinner.
- I am a sinner.

955
01:54:06,690 --> 01:54:08,590
Louder, Daniel! I am a sinner!

956
01:54:08,725 --> 01:54:11,660
- I am a sinner.
- I am sorry, Lord.

957
01:54:11,762 --> 01:54:13,923
- I am sorry, Lord.
- I want the blood.

958
01:54:14,064 --> 01:54:17,431
- I want the blood.
- You have abandoned your child.

959
01:54:18,201 --> 01:54:19,498
I have abandoned my child.

960
01:54:19,603 --> 01:54:21,935
- I will never backslide.
- I will never backslide.

961
01:54:22,072 --> 01:54:25,064
I was lost, but now I am found.

962
01:54:25,208 --> 01:54:29,110
- I was lost, but now I'm found.
- I have abandoned my child.

963
01:54:30,881 --> 01:54:34,044
Say it. Say it.

964
01:54:34,151 --> 01:54:37,177
- I abandoned my child.
- Say it louder. Say it louder!

965
01:54:37,287 --> 01:54:39,380
I've abandoned my child!

966
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,815
I've abandoned my child!

967
01:54:42,959 --> 01:54:44,950
I've abandoned my boy!

968
01:54:45,095 --> 01:54:47,495
Now beg for the blood!

969
01:54:48,699 --> 01:54:50,564
Just give me the blood, Eli.
Let me get out of here.

970
01:54:50,667 --> 01:54:53,431
Give me the blood, Lord,
and let me get away!

971
01:54:53,537 --> 01:54:57,303
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior?

972
01:54:57,441 --> 01:55:00,171
- Yes, I do.
- Get out of here, devil!

973
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:03,108
Out, devil! Out, sin!

974
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:05,805
- Let me feel the power of the Lord, Eli.
- Do you accept

975
01:55:05,949 --> 01:55:09,817
the Church of the Third Revelation
as your spiritual guide?

976
01:55:11,354 --> 01:55:15,552
- Get out of here, ghost!
- Where is your Lord, Eli?

977
01:55:15,692 --> 01:55:19,753
- Get out! Go back where you belong!
- Where is he? There he is!

978
01:55:19,896 --> 01:55:23,491
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Savior?

979
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:25,033
Yes, I do.

980
01:55:27,804 --> 01:55:32,104
<i>Would you be free</i>
<i>from the burden of sin?</i>

981
01:55:32,242 --> 01:55:34,574
<i>There's power in the blood</i>

982
01:55:34,711 --> 01:55:36,736
<i>Power in the blood</i>

983
01:55:37,013 --> 01:55:38,810
<i>Would you o'er evil a victory win?</i>

984
01:55:38,915 --> 01:55:41,110
There's a pipeline.

985
01:55:41,251 --> 01:55:45,415
<i>There's wonderful power in the blood</i>

986
01:55:45,555 --> 01:55:49,924
<i>There is power, power</i>
<i>wonder-working power</i>

987
01:55:50,026 --> 01:55:53,723
<i>In the blood of the Lamb</i>

988
01:55:53,830 --> 01:55:55,593
Praise the Lord!

989
01:56:00,203 --> 01:56:03,070
Welcome to the fold, brother Plainview.

990
01:56:14,417 --> 01:56:16,681
Welcome, brother Daniel.
God bless you.

991
01:56:17,954 --> 01:56:19,387
God bless you.

992
01:56:22,559 --> 01:56:24,220
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

993
01:56:24,661 --> 01:56:26,595
Welcome home, brother.

994
01:56:27,230 --> 01:56:30,688
That's enough. That's enough, now.

995
01:56:32,936 --> 01:56:37,100
He must take the spirit in on his own.

996
01:56:39,876 --> 01:56:41,741
We have a new member.

997
01:56:41,878 --> 01:56:44,005
- Yes, brother.
- Hallelujah.

998
01:56:44,114 --> 01:56:46,082
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

999
01:56:48,251 --> 01:56:50,344
- My sweet Mary.
- Mr. Plainview has been generous

1000
01:56:50,453 --> 01:56:53,183
enough to make a $5,000 donation

1001
01:56:53,323 --> 01:56:56,349
to the church
which we are still waiting for.

1002
01:58:08,498 --> 01:58:11,797
That does me good.
That does me good.

1003
01:58:13,904 --> 01:58:15,735
Welcome home, son.

1004
01:58:18,341 --> 01:58:20,309
Welcome home, son.

1005
01:58:24,247 --> 01:58:26,306
This here's George Reynolds.
Teacher from the deaf school.

1006
01:58:26,416 --> 01:58:29,408
- Mr. Plainview.
- Fletcher.

1007
01:58:32,222 --> 01:58:34,315
You're too heavy for me.

1008
01:58:37,394 --> 01:58:40,090
Do you want to get something to eat?

1009
01:58:41,298 --> 01:58:45,598
That's the pipeline, see?
All the way to the sea.

1010
01:59:06,723 --> 01:59:08,281
Come here.

1011
01:59:15,165 --> 01:59:16,928
I love you, son.

1012
01:59:18,835 --> 01:59:20,962
Let's take a look at you.

1013
01:59:23,239 --> 01:59:26,106
All right. That's it, that's it. That's it.

1014
01:59:50,166 --> 01:59:53,465
Let's get some decent food
inside of you.

1015
01:59:53,570 --> 01:59:57,370
That's all we need here
is a good, strong, expensive meal.

1016
01:59:58,008 --> 01:59:59,498
You hungry?

1017
02:00:00,577 --> 02:00:01,669
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir.

1018
02:00:01,811 --> 02:00:04,803
Two steaks, a whiskey,
and water for him.

1019
02:00:06,449 --> 02:00:08,974
- And goat's milk.
- Very good, sir.

1020
02:00:15,792 --> 02:00:18,727
We're going to have
this teacher help you.

1021
02:00:19,295 --> 02:00:23,755
He's going to help take care
of all of this. Understand?

1022
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:26,596
'Cause I need you. Need your help.

1023
02:00:26,736 --> 02:00:30,695
Got everything we need now
to build this company. Come here.

1024
02:00:38,515 --> 02:00:40,210
Good afternoon.

1025
02:00:56,366 --> 02:00:58,425
- How are you doing?
- It's nice to see you again.

1026
02:00:58,535 --> 02:01:01,333
- We need four.
- I'll have them right up.

1027
02:01:05,508 --> 02:01:07,499
- Good afternoon, Daniel.
- Tilford.

1028
02:01:07,610 --> 02:01:08,975
Good afternoon.

1029
02:01:10,547 --> 02:01:15,814
- Hello! H.M. Tilford!
- You don't have to shout.

1030
02:01:17,854 --> 02:01:19,253
Pleasure.

1031
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:26,224
It's good to be in Little B.

1032
02:01:27,497 --> 02:01:30,796
- Could use some rain out here.
- Yeah, we could.

1033
02:01:31,668 --> 02:01:34,762
- There we go.
- R.J., how's the London broil?

1034
02:01:34,904 --> 02:01:37,566
Believe we ordered these drinks
before those people.

1035
02:01:37,674 --> 02:01:41,940
- R.J., tell us. How's the London broil?
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Sorry.

1036
02:01:44,013 --> 02:01:47,949
I am sorry about that, sir.
I'll have your steaks right out.

1037
02:01:57,794 --> 02:02:00,354
- So that green turtle soup is fantastic.
- Is it?

1038
02:02:00,497 --> 02:02:02,124
It's delicious.

1039
02:02:07,170 --> 02:02:08,137
Sounds good to me.

1040
02:02:08,271 --> 02:02:14,005
So Standard offered us a million
dollars for the Little Boston leases.

1041
02:02:14,110 --> 02:02:17,011
I told H.M. Tilford
where he could shove that.

1042
02:02:17,113 --> 02:02:21,709
And we made a deal with Union!
On the pipeline!

1043
02:02:21,851 --> 02:02:25,309
And that whole ocean of oil
underneath our fields.

1044
02:02:25,421 --> 02:02:27,082
...$150,000.
- Yes.

1045
02:02:27,190 --> 02:02:29,488
We needed the money to drill.

1046
02:02:29,626 --> 02:02:31,856
- Who is this guy?
- I go out to meet him.

1047
02:02:31,961 --> 02:02:34,725
He's getting oil on the property.
We're trying to make a claim on it.

1048
02:02:34,864 --> 02:02:36,764
Offered him a million dollars.

1049
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:40,097
- Turned us down flat.
- Well, I'm hungry.

1050
02:02:40,236 --> 02:02:44,866
Orange fritters,
mashed potatoes, green peas.

1051
02:02:44,974 --> 02:02:47,442
- All the way around?
- All right.

1052
02:02:50,346 --> 02:02:51,711
Hold on.

1053
02:02:55,485 --> 02:02:57,749
I want you to look over there.

1054
02:02:57,854 --> 02:03:00,652
- Daniel, let me introduce...
- Look over there. You see?

1055
02:03:00,790 --> 02:03:02,883
That's my son. See him?

1056
02:03:02,992 --> 02:03:05,324
- Yes.
- Do you see?

1057
02:03:07,664 --> 02:03:09,097
I see him.

1058
02:03:09,966 --> 02:03:12,833
You don't tell me
how to raise my family.

1059
02:03:14,971 --> 02:03:18,498
I told you not to tell me
how to raise my family.

1060
02:03:19,976 --> 02:03:21,841
Daniel...

1061
02:03:22,679 --> 02:03:24,510
So what do you see?

1062
02:03:26,516 --> 02:03:29,679
- I'm very happy for you that the deal...
- Yes, I made a deal with Union.

1063
02:03:29,786 --> 02:03:32,152
- My son is happy. He's safe.
- Congratulations.

1064
02:03:32,255 --> 02:03:35,418
- I'm taking care of him now, so...
- Excellent.

1065
02:03:36,726 --> 02:03:39,718
You look like a fool, don't you, Tilford?

1066
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:47,233
- Yes.
- Yes.

1067
02:03:49,072 --> 02:03:50,733
Yes, you do.

1068
02:03:51,641 --> 02:03:53,108
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1069
02:03:53,443 --> 02:03:56,674
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse him, gentlemen.

1070
02:04:00,216 --> 02:04:02,844
I told you what I was going to do.

1071
02:04:13,162 --> 02:04:14,390
My son.

1072
02:04:32,448 --> 02:04:35,747
Mr. Sunday, I understand
that you're leaving our fair community.

1073
02:04:35,885 --> 02:04:39,013
- Yes, I'm going on a mission.
- Where you going?

1074
02:04:39,122 --> 02:04:41,283
Oildale, Taft,
and then on to Bakersfield.

1075
02:04:41,424 --> 02:04:43,756
Well, I want you to know...

1076
02:04:43,893 --> 02:04:45,758
Three quarters of an hour.

1077
02:04:45,895 --> 02:04:47,419
...you done a great job for us.

1078
02:04:47,563 --> 02:04:50,430
- Thank you. You will be in my prayers.
- I thank you very much.

1079
02:04:50,533 --> 02:04:53,798
Union Oil Company,
Santa Paula, California.

1080
02:07:02,799 --> 02:07:06,599
"The woman saith unto him,
'Sir, give me this water

1081
02:07:07,637 --> 02:07:12,597
"'and I shall thirst not,
neither come hither to draw."'

1082
02:08:54,110 --> 02:08:55,771
Come in, come in.

1083
02:09:22,538 --> 02:09:24,768
Can we be alone?

1084
02:09:24,874 --> 02:09:28,571
This is my closest associate.
He hears everything.

1085
02:09:35,651 --> 02:09:40,714
- I'd prefer to speak to you in private.
- You can't speak.

1086
02:09:40,823 --> 02:09:43,053
So why don't you flap your hands about

1087
02:09:43,159 --> 02:09:46,720
and have what's-his-name tell me
where you've been.

1088
02:09:54,704 --> 02:09:57,434
Or do you think I don't know?

1089
02:10:11,921 --> 02:10:14,151
This is hard for me to say.

1090
02:10:15,257 --> 02:10:19,387
I'll tell you first, I love you very much.

1091
02:10:22,665 --> 02:10:26,658
I've learned to love what I do
because of you.

1092
02:10:30,106 --> 02:10:31,971
I'm leaving here.

1093
02:10:33,409 --> 02:10:35,741
I'm going to Mexico.

1094
02:10:35,878 --> 02:10:38,847
I'm taking Mary,
and I'm going to Mexico.

1095
02:10:40,516 --> 02:10:42,609
I miss working outside.

1096
02:10:43,653 --> 02:10:45,518
I miss the fields.

1097
02:10:48,491 --> 02:10:50,618
It'll only be for a time,

1098
02:10:51,827 --> 02:10:54,159
for me to do my own drilling

1099
02:10:55,865 --> 02:10:57,992
and start my own company.

1100
02:11:01,003 --> 02:11:05,463
It's time to make a change.

1101
02:11:18,521 --> 02:11:21,012
This makes you my competitor.

1102
02:11:24,994 --> 02:11:30,091
- No. No, it's not like that.
- It is like that, boy.

1103
02:11:31,333 --> 02:11:33,301
Your own company, huh?

1104
02:11:33,736 --> 02:11:35,226
That's right.

1105
02:11:37,573 --> 02:11:39,336
In Mexico?

1106
02:11:40,810 --> 02:11:41,868
Yes.

1107
02:11:41,977 --> 02:11:47,040
You are making such a misstep.
So, what are you doing?

1108
02:11:49,085 --> 02:11:52,418
I know you and I
have disagreed over many things.

1109
02:11:53,355 --> 02:11:57,689
I'd rather keep you as my father
than my partner.

1110
02:11:57,793 --> 02:11:59,260
Then say it.

1111
02:11:59,395 --> 02:12:01,090
If you've got something to say to me,
then say it.

1112
02:12:01,197 --> 02:12:04,860
I'd like to hear you speak
instead of your little dog.

1113
02:12:22,985 --> 02:12:25,647
I'm going to Mexico with my wife.

1114
02:12:26,655 --> 02:12:28,782
I'm going away from you.

1115
02:12:34,830 --> 02:12:37,492
That wasn't so hard, was it?

1116
02:12:39,435 --> 02:12:42,063
Killing us with what you're doing.

1117
02:12:44,974 --> 02:12:48,432
You're killing my image of you
as my son.

1118
02:12:48,577 --> 02:12:51,944
You are stubborn. You won't listen.

1119
02:12:52,081 --> 02:12:54,379
You're not my son.

1120
02:12:54,483 --> 02:12:57,680
Please don't say that.
I know you don't mean it.

1121
02:12:57,787 --> 02:13:01,746
It's the truth. You're not my son.
You never have been.

1122
02:13:03,125 --> 02:13:04,922
You're an orphan!

1123
02:13:07,630 --> 02:13:09,860
Did you ever hear that word?

1124
02:13:11,367 --> 02:13:13,267
Tell him what I said.

1125
02:13:14,036 --> 02:13:17,005
You operated here today like one.

1126
02:13:18,641 --> 02:13:21,109
I should have seen this coming.

1127
02:13:22,611 --> 02:13:27,446
I should have known that,
under this all, these past years

1128
02:13:27,583 --> 02:13:30,950
you've been building new hate for me,
piece by piece.

1129
02:13:31,086 --> 02:13:34,715
I don't even know who you are
because you have none of me in you.

1130
02:13:34,824 --> 02:13:37,691
You're someone else's.

1131
02:13:39,128 --> 02:13:42,586
This anger. Your maliciousness.

1132
02:13:43,699 --> 02:13:46,600
Backwards dealings with me.

1133
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:52,229
You're an orphan from a basket
in the middle of the desert.

1134
02:13:55,044 --> 02:14:00,004
And I took you for no other reason
than I needed a sweet face to buy land.

1135
02:14:01,517 --> 02:14:03,280
Did you get that?

1136
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:06,283
So now you know.

1137
02:14:09,592 --> 02:14:13,892
Look at me!
You're lower than a bastard.

1138
02:14:38,854 --> 02:14:43,314
You have none of me in you.
You're just a bastard from a basket.

1139
02:14:53,002 --> 02:14:57,268
I thank God I have none of you in me.

1140
02:15:02,177 --> 02:15:06,637
Not my son.
Just a little piece of competition.

1141
02:15:08,550 --> 02:15:10,643
Bastard from a basket.

1142
02:15:13,055 --> 02:15:15,250
Bastard from a basket!

1143
02:15:23,632 --> 02:15:26,157
You're a bastard from a basket!

1144
02:16:28,697 --> 02:16:30,494
<i>Get up, Mr. Daniel.</i>

1145
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:36,428
<i>Mr. Daniel.</i>

1146
02:16:38,407 --> 02:16:40,967
Mr. Daniel, you've got a visitor.

1147
02:16:44,646 --> 02:16:46,477
Wake up, Mr. Daniel.

1148
02:16:49,218 --> 02:16:50,810
Sir?

1149
02:17:04,333 --> 02:17:06,267
You can leave us now.

1150
02:17:14,576 --> 02:17:15,543
Daniel.

1151
02:17:18,914 --> 02:17:20,074
Daniel.

1152
02:17:22,684 --> 02:17:25,881
Daniel Plainview, the house is on fire!

1153
02:17:30,559 --> 02:17:33,528
Brother Daniel, it's Eli.

1154
02:17:43,772 --> 02:17:47,503
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

1155
02:17:49,611 --> 02:17:51,545
I'll make us a drink.

1156
02:17:58,120 --> 02:18:01,283
Your home is a miracle.

1157
02:18:02,558 --> 02:18:03,826
It's beautiful.

1158
02:18:03,826 --> 02:18:04,190
It's beautiful.

1159
02:18:04,827 --> 02:18:06,886
God bless it.

1160
02:18:07,029 --> 02:18:11,022
I've been spreading His word
far and wide.

1161
02:18:12,301 --> 02:18:14,098
Far and wide.

1162
02:18:15,904 --> 02:18:18,668
So much travel for Him.

1163
02:18:23,378 --> 02:18:25,778
I've been working in radio.

1164
02:18:28,484 --> 02:18:32,443
Yes, so much...
So much has been happening.

1165
02:18:33,489 --> 02:18:38,950
To be here and find you
and see you well is wonderful.

1166
02:18:39,094 --> 02:18:41,654
And we have a chance to catch up.

1167
02:18:54,810 --> 02:18:56,869
No. Thank you so much.

1168
02:19:14,997 --> 02:19:16,521
My brother.

1169
02:19:17,933 --> 02:19:21,198
Daniel, my brother by marriage.

1170
02:19:23,205 --> 02:19:27,301
We're such old friends. So much time.

1171
02:19:33,815 --> 02:19:36,909
Things go up, things go down,

1172
02:19:37,019 --> 02:19:41,319
but at least the Lord is always around.

1173
02:19:42,925 --> 02:19:45,587
We've seen ups and downs,
haven't we?

1174
02:19:49,398 --> 02:19:52,367
Are things down for you right now, Eli?

1175
02:19:53,735 --> 02:19:55,134
No. No.

1176
02:19:57,573 --> 02:20:00,201
But I do come with some sad news.

1177
02:20:01,944 --> 02:20:04,674
Perhaps you remember Mr. Bandy?

1178
02:20:07,316 --> 02:20:10,649
Mr. Bandy has passed on to the Lord.

1179
02:20:11,587 --> 02:20:14,750
He lived to be 99 years old,
God bless him.

1180
02:20:15,457 --> 02:20:19,325
Mr. Bandy has a grandson.
Have you met his grandson, William?

1181
02:20:20,329 --> 02:20:24,925
William Bandy is one of
the finest members we have

1182
02:20:25,033 --> 02:20:27,593
at the Church of the Third Revelation.

1183
02:20:27,703 --> 02:20:31,002
He's eager to come to Hollywood
to be in movies.

1184
02:20:32,474 --> 02:20:34,635
He is very good-looking.

1185
02:20:36,845 --> 02:20:41,839
- And I do think he will have success.
- That's wonderful.

1186
02:20:43,986 --> 02:20:46,750
Would you like me to speak with him?

1187
02:20:54,162 --> 02:20:58,895
Daniel, I'm asking
if you'd like to have business

1188
02:20:59,034 --> 02:21:01,264
with the Church of the Third Revelation

1189
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:05,602
in developing this lease
on young Bandy's 1,000-acre tract.

1190
02:21:08,076 --> 02:21:09,668
I'm offering you to drill

1191
02:21:09,811 --> 02:21:13,269
on one of the great undeveloped fields
of Little Boston.

1192
02:21:13,382 --> 02:21:17,512
- I'd be happy to work with you.
- You would?

1193
02:21:19,121 --> 02:21:21,954
Yes, yes, of course. That's wonderful.

1194
02:21:22,090 --> 02:21:25,059
But there is one condition for this work.

1195
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:26,650
All right.

1196
02:21:28,730 --> 02:21:32,257
I'd like you to tell me
that you are a false prophet.

1197
02:21:37,639 --> 02:21:43,043
I'd like you to tell me that you are,
and have been a false prophet.

1198
02:21:44,246 --> 02:21:46,612
And that God is a superstition.

1199
02:21:52,721 --> 02:21:54,518
But that's a lie.

1200
02:21:57,326 --> 02:21:59,851
It's a lie. I cannot say it.

1201
02:22:14,142 --> 02:22:16,576
- When can we begin to drill?
- Very soon.

1202
02:22:16,678 --> 02:22:18,270
How long will it take
to bring in the well?

1203
02:22:18,413 --> 02:22:20,313
It shouldn't take long.

1204
02:22:20,449 --> 02:22:23,714
I would like a $100,000 signing bonus,

1205
02:22:23,819 --> 02:22:27,084
plus the five that is owed to me
with interest.

1206
02:22:27,789 --> 02:22:29,552
That's only fair.

1207
02:22:35,330 --> 02:22:40,097
I am a false prophet,
and God is a superstition.

1208
02:22:40,235 --> 02:22:43,204
If that's what you believe,
then I will say it.

1209
02:22:43,305 --> 02:22:46,797
- Say it like you mean it.
- Daniel.

1210
02:22:47,342 --> 02:22:49,674
Say it like it's your sermon.

1211
02:22:52,848 --> 02:22:54,475
Don't smile.

1212
02:23:00,255 --> 02:23:02,155
I am a false prophet.

1213
02:23:02,257 --> 02:23:05,590
- God is a superstition.
- Why don't you stand up?

1214
02:23:08,663 --> 02:23:10,654
Put your glass down.

1215
02:23:22,844 --> 02:23:26,405
I am a false prophet.

1216
02:23:26,548 --> 02:23:29,608
- God is a superstition.
- Eli, stop.

1217
02:23:29,718 --> 02:23:35,122
Just imagine this is your church here
and you have a full congregation, so...

1218
02:23:37,659 --> 02:23:41,425
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1219
02:23:41,530 --> 02:23:43,122
Say it again.

1220
02:23:44,199 --> 02:23:48,067
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1221
02:23:48,170 --> 02:23:49,296
They can't hear you at the back.

1222
02:23:49,438 --> 02:23:52,805
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1223
02:23:52,941 --> 02:23:53,965
Say it again.

1224
02:23:54,109 --> 02:23:58,739
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1225
02:23:58,847 --> 02:24:00,542
Say it again.

1226
02:24:00,649 --> 02:24:04,380
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1227
02:24:05,587 --> 02:24:07,919
Those areas have been drilled.

1228
02:24:11,026 --> 02:24:12,425
What?

1229
02:24:12,561 --> 02:24:15,155
Those areas, they've been drilled.

1230
02:24:16,765 --> 02:24:20,292
- No, they haven't.
- Yes, it's...

1231
02:24:20,402 --> 02:24:21,733
It's called drainage, Eli.

1232
02:24:21,870 --> 02:24:26,705
See, I own everything around it, so,
of course, I get what's underneath it.

1233
02:24:28,176 --> 02:24:31,339
But there are no derricks there.

1234
02:24:31,480 --> 02:24:33,846
This is the Bandy tract.
Do you understand?

1235
02:24:33,982 --> 02:24:35,950
Do you understand, Eli?

1236
02:24:36,685 --> 02:24:39,916
That's more to the point.
Do you understand?

1237
02:24:40,021 --> 02:24:45,425
I drink your water. I drink it up every day.

1238
02:24:46,428 --> 02:24:50,660
I drink the blood of Lamb
from Bandy's tract.

1239
02:24:55,937 --> 02:24:58,030
You can sit down again.

1240
02:25:16,191 --> 02:25:17,522
Daniel.

1241
02:25:20,795 --> 02:25:21,784
Daniel.

1242
02:25:25,667 --> 02:25:26,964
Please.

1243
02:25:29,604 --> 02:25:33,938
- I am in desperate times.
- I know.

1244
02:25:34,042 --> 02:25:36,909
- I need a friend.
- Yes. Of course, you do.

1245
02:25:37,312 --> 02:25:38,904
I've sinned.

1246
02:25:40,682 --> 02:25:43,776
I need help. I'm a sinner.

1247
02:25:43,919 --> 02:25:48,515
I've let the devil grab hold of me
in ways I never imagined.

1248
02:25:48,623 --> 02:25:50,056
I'm so full of sin.

1249
02:25:50,158 --> 02:25:53,423
The Lord sometimes challenges us,
doesn't He, Eli?

1250
02:25:53,562 --> 02:25:55,530
- Yes, He does, Daniel.
- Yes, He does.

1251
02:25:55,630 --> 02:25:58,224
Yes, He does!

1252
02:25:58,366 --> 02:26:00,266
Yes, He does!

1253
02:26:01,570 --> 02:26:07,133
He's completely failed to alert me
to the recent panic in our economy.

1254
02:26:07,242 --> 02:26:09,403
- And this...
- Oh, dear.

1255
02:26:09,544 --> 02:26:16,211
I must have this, Daniel.
I must, I must, I must have this.

1256
02:26:16,351 --> 02:26:18,615
My investments have...

1257
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:23,748
Daniel, I won't bore you, but if I could
grab the Lord's hand for help I would,

1258
02:26:23,858 --> 02:26:26,759
but He does these things all the time.

1259
02:26:26,861 --> 02:26:30,820
These mysteries that He presents,
and while we wait...

1260
02:26:32,100 --> 02:26:34,261
While we wait for His word!

1261
02:26:34,402 --> 02:26:37,138
Because you're not
the chosen brother, Eli.

1262
02:26:37,138 --> 02:26:37,365
Because you're not
the chosen brother, Eli.

1263
02:26:39,774 --> 02:26:43,574
'Twas Paul who was chosen.

1264
02:26:44,479 --> 02:26:47,414
He found me and told me
about your land. You're just a fool.

1265
02:26:47,549 --> 02:26:50,382
- Why are you talking about Paul?
- I did what your brother couldn't.

1266
02:26:50,485 --> 02:26:53,010
- Don't say this to me.
- I broke you and I beat you.

1267
02:26:53,922 --> 02:26:56,720
It was Paul told me about you.

1268
02:26:56,858 --> 02:27:01,318
He's the prophet. He's the smart one.
He knew what was there

1269
02:27:01,429 --> 02:27:03,795
and he found me to take it
out of the ground.

1270
02:27:03,898 --> 02:27:06,992
Know what the funny thing is?
Listen, listen.

1271
02:27:07,869 --> 02:27:11,771
I paid him $10,000 cash in hand.
Just like that.

1272
02:27:12,807 --> 02:27:16,140
He has his own company now.
Prosperous little business.

1273
02:27:16,244 --> 02:27:19,771
Three wells producing, $5,000 a week.

1274
02:27:21,850 --> 02:27:25,650
Stop crying, you sniveling ass.
Stop your nonsense.

1275
02:27:26,855 --> 02:27:30,689
- You're just the afterbirth, Eli.
- No.

1276
02:27:30,792 --> 02:27:33,420
That slithered out on your mother's filth.

1277
02:27:33,561 --> 02:27:34,892
No.

1278
02:27:34,996 --> 02:27:39,194
They should've put you in a glass jar
on the mantelpiece.

1279
02:27:40,902 --> 02:27:44,269
Where were you when Paul
was suckling at his mother's teat?

1280
02:27:44,406 --> 02:27:45,896
Where were you?

1281
02:27:46,041 --> 02:27:50,740
Who was nursing you, poor Eli?
One of Bandy's sows?

1282
02:27:50,879 --> 02:27:53,814
That land has been had.
Nothing you can do about it. It's gone.

1283
02:27:53,915 --> 02:27:56,076
- If you would just take this lease...
- You lose.

1284
02:27:56,217 --> 02:27:59,448
Drainage!

1285
02:28:00,488 --> 02:28:04,049
Drainage, Eli, you boy.

1286
02:28:05,193 --> 02:28:08,094
Drained dry. I'm so sorry.

1287
02:28:09,330 --> 02:28:11,423
If you have a milkshake

1288
02:28:12,534 --> 02:28:14,297
and I have a milkshake,

1289
02:28:14,402 --> 02:28:17,599
and I have a straw, there it is.
That's the straw, you see?

1290
02:28:17,706 --> 02:28:19,264
Watch it.

1291
02:28:20,709 --> 02:28:27,638
Now my straw reaches across the room

1292
02:28:28,917 --> 02:28:31,715
and starts to drink your milkshake.

1293
02:28:32,654 --> 02:28:36,420
I drink your milkshake!

1294
02:28:38,626 --> 02:28:42,084
- I drink it up!
- Don't bully me, Daniel.

1295
02:28:44,833 --> 02:28:50,032
Did you think your song and dance and
your superstition would help you, Eli?

1296
02:28:50,171 --> 02:28:54,801
I am the Third Revelation.
I am who the Lord has chosen.

1297
02:28:57,011 --> 02:28:59,309
- Daniel!
- Because I'm smarter than you!

1298
02:28:59,414 --> 02:29:00,881
I'm older!

1299
02:29:01,716 --> 02:29:03,547
I'm your old friend, Daniel!

1300
02:29:03,651 --> 02:29:06,085
- I'm not a false prophet...
- Help me! Help me!

1301
02:29:06,187 --> 02:29:08,451
...you sniveling boy!

1302
02:29:08,556 --> 02:29:15,223
I am the Third Revelation!
I am the Third Revelation!

1303
02:29:15,330 --> 02:29:18,299
- I told you I would eat you.
- We're family!

1304
02:29:18,433 --> 02:29:22,870
- I told you I would eat you up!
- We're brothers! We're brothers!

1305
02:29:29,978 --> 02:29:32,776
Daniel, please forgive me. I beg you.

1306
02:29:36,451 --> 02:29:38,510
That's it. That's it.

1307
02:30:40,915 --> 02:30:42,382
Mr. Daniel?

1308
02:30:50,291 --> 02:30:51,952
I'm finished.
