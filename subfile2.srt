So, you are mesmerized
no more?

1851

I am still mesmerized.

You okay with that?

1855
01:56:57,762 --> 01:57:00,095
Does the whoring thing
challenge the desire

1856
01:57:00,178 --> 01:57:02,178
for ownership that men have?

1857

1859

I find myself merely jealous
of the men's time with you
